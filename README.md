[Live Demo](https://prolegioncart.netlify.app/)

Prolegion Cart is a modern, **React + TypeScript** shopping cart application. It uses **Redux Toolkit** for state management, **React Router** for navigation, and **Tailwind CSS** for styling. All components are fully typed using TypeScript for better type safety and maintainability. Users can browse products, add them to the cart, view cart details, and receive interactive notifications using `react-hot-toast`.
